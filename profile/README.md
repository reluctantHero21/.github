# Hi, I'm [Tony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonykliu/) 👋
<!-- ![My picture](/profile/img/headshot-200px.jpg) -->

## My story 👨‍💻
A few years ago, I left my career in accounting to pursue a self-taught journey in InfoSec. I am now relearning coding basics in order to build useful scripts as a security engineer.

## Assignments and coursework 💭
Examples of programs I've written as part of CS assignments and coursework:
- [Credit card validator](https://github.com/reluctantHero21/cs50x/blob/main/c/credit/readme.md): A program in C that checks the validity of a card number based on Luhn's checksum
- [Substitution cipher](https://github.com/reluctantHero21/cs50x/blob/main/c/substitution/readme.md): A program in C that converts plaintext to ciphertext using a substitution cipher
- [Merge and order arrays](https://github.com/reluctantHero21/comp202/tree/main/java/array-merge-sort): A Java program that merges and sorts arrays of strings alphabetically using bubble sort

Feel free to browse through my [CS50x](https://github.com/reluctantHero21/cs50x) and [COMP202](https://github.com/reluctantHero21/comp202) repos for more interesting code snippets and programs.
